Learning how to encode and decode files using a Huffman tree

This is meant to be a base code to teach myself how to encode and decode stings using a Huffman Tree.

Goals:
 - Get the system working overall to create a useable tree
 - Write out the tree and encoded string in the smallest way possible (or easily done)
 - Read the tree and encoded text back in to decode the message
 - Provide tools to evaluate the compression achieved in the encoding
 - Allow for an adaptave method using longer than single character basic nodes
